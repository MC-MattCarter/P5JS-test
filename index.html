        <h1>Just months after bankruptcy, <span class="company">Hertz</span> says it will buy <span class="number">100,000</span> Teslas for new <span class="fuel">electric</span> fleet</h1>
        <h2>Shares of <span class="company">Tesla</span> surged on Monday, with the <span class="company">Hertz</span> deal expected to net the <span class="fuel">electric</span> car maker more than <span class="money">$4 billion</span>.</h2>
        <h3>By <span class="human">Paul A. Eisenstein</span></h3>

        <p>With <span class="sport">football</span> superstar <span class="human">Tom Brady</span> set to pitch the deal, <span class="company">Hertz</span> plans to field <span class="number">100,000</span> Tesla <span class="fuel">electric</span> cars through its North American and European rental car fleets.</p>

        <p>The move will position the rental company as the largest source of <span class="fuel">electric</span> vehicle rentals in the U.S., and one of the biggest in Europe, at a time when <span class="fuel">electric</span> vehicles are beginning to gain real traction. In turn, it could help not just <span class="company">Tesla</span>, but the auto industry overall, by increasing awareness of what today’s latest <span class="fuel">electric</span> vehicles can do.</p>

        <p>The one-time rental car leader declared bankruptcy in May 2020, re-emerging <span class="number">13</span> months later. Earlier this month, it announced that former <span class="company">Ford</span> CEO <span class="human">Mark Fields</span> would come on board as its interim chief executive.</p>

        <p>"<span class="fuel">Electric</span> vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest," <span class="human">Fields</span> said in a statement on Monday. "The new <span class="company">Hertz</span> is going to lead the way as a mobility company, starting with the largest <span class="fuel">EV</span> rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our <span class="fuel">EV</span> fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world."</p>

        <p>To help get the message across, <span class="company">Hertz</span> said it is “teaming up” with <span class="human">Tom Brady</span>, the seven-time Super Bowl champion. Two ads featuring <span class="human">Brady</span> — and using his familiar game day “Let’s Go” rallying cry — will begin airing as of Monday. Customers already can begin scheduling <span class="company">Tesla</span> rentals through <span class="company">Hertz</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="company">Hertz</span> will add <span class="number">100,000</span> Teslas — primarily the Model 3 — to its fleet by the end of 2022, <span class="human">Fields</span> said in a statement. It also will set up a network of <span class="number">3,000</span> quick chargers in <span class="number">65</span> markets by the end of next year. Customers will also have access to <span class="company">Tesla</span>'s own Supercharger network.</p>

        <p><span class="company">Tesla</span> stock surged Monday, propelling the <span class="fuel">electric</span> car maker's valuation closer to <span class="money">$1 trillion</span>.</p>

        <p>The deal is “non-exclusive,” <span class="company">Hertz</span> spokesman <span class="human">Ray Day</span> told NBC News, adding that the rental company “is open to working with all automakers.”</p>

        <p>While <span class="human">Day</span> declined to say if <span class="company">Hertz</span> currently is negotiating deals with other manufacturers, it would have plenty of options to choose from. There were <span class="number">13</span> BEVs on sale in the U.S. at the end of the 2021 model year.</p>

        <p>While <span class="fuel">electric</span> models currently make up less than <span class="number">3</span> percent of the U.S. market, demand more than doubled during the first half of 2022 as more and more new models came to market. In Europe, demand is growing even faster, with <span class="company">Tesla</span>'s Model <span class="number">3</span> the top-selling vehicle last month, according to data out Monday from Jato Dynamics research firm.</p>

        <p>President <span class="president">Joe Biden</span> is pushing to have <span class="fuel">electric</span> vehicles make up between <span class="number">40</span> to <span class="number">50</span> percent of new sales in the U.S. by 2030. California, New York and Washington have all set up timetables for completely banning vehicles using internal combustion engines. So have Britain and Norway, with several other European countries considering similar moves.</p>

        <p>By putting vehicles into the <span class="company">Hertz</span> fleet, <span class="company">Tesla</span> should be able to increase its brand awareness at a time when it is preparing to open two new assembly plants in Texas and Germany, roughly doubling its production capacity, said analyst <span class="human">Stephanie Brinley</span> of IHS Markit.</p>

        <p>“<span class="company">Tesla</span> is probably the only manufacturer that could deliver this many (<span class="fuel">electric</span> vehicles) this quickly,” she said.</p>

        <p>But the deal could prove to be “a double-edged sword,” cautioned <span class="human">Sam Abuelsamid</span>, lead automotive analyst with Guidehouse Insight. “Putting a lot of vehicles into a rental fleet gives your products a lot of exposure to potential customers. But it can create over-exposure and hurt your resale values."</p>
